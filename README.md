## How to use colors.
You add colors as you normally do. Only diffrence are Gradiens.
You can do for example:
"&7this tex will not have gradient<#5e4fa2:#f79459>but this text will have gradient &6this will not have gradient."



## Two methods you can use.
```
//Json
TextTranslator.toComponent("your message");
//or use this So can you also set your default color.

TextTranslator.toComponent("your message","set defult color");

//spigot format.
TextTranslator.toSpigotFormat("your message");

//I have also added a check you can use if a string contains a valid hex color code.
//I already check it in the code, but if you need to check itself, you can use this.
TextTranslator.getInstance().isValidHexCode("your hex you want to check");

```
